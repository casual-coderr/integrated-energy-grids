\begin{itemize}

\item[1 point] Proper discussion of optimal capacity/generation mix including plots for the dispatch for one week in summer and winter, annual electricity mix and duration curves. 

\item[1 point] Proper discussion of the optimum capacity mix vs global CO2 constraint.

\item[1 point] Proper discussion on interannual sensitivity including plots for average capacities (obtained for different weather years) and interannual variability.
(0.5 points if average and variability are calculated + 0.5 points if the reasoning of differences among technologies is provided)

\item[1 point] Proper discussion on storage technologies and how they modify the optimal capacity mix.

\item[1 point] 0.5 points for calculation of CO$_2$ price and reporting on currently existing CO$_2$ price + 0.5 points for the comparision between them and reasoning

\item[1.5 points] 0.5 points for the description of the interconnection approach selected + 0.5 points for the model implementation + 0.5 points for reasoning on the impacts of the interconnected model compared to a single node. 

\item[1.5 points]  0.5 points for the description of the sector-coupling approach selected + 0.5 points for the model implementation + 0.5 points for reasoning on the impacts of the sector-coupled model compared to the single node.

\item[1 point] 0.5 points for the research question identified + 0.5 points for a description of the modelling approach to investigate it. 

\item[1 point]  The text is clear and well structured, figures can be easily read and include proper captions and units.
